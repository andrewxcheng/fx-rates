The following guide will demonstrate how to scrape FX rates from online payment providers, such as Convera, illustrating the magnitude of the FX margins baked into the rates.
## Obtaining FX Rates From Convera
### Step 1: Opening students.convera.com
The first step to obtaining an FX rate from Convera is to type in the country of the school. Once the country field is completed, Convera will populate the drop-down list of institutions with all the schools from that institution.
### Step 2: Selecting an institution
Once the list of available institutions is created, the school can be selected. This step takes us to the next page of the process.
### Step 3: Select a country and payment amount
Convera then provides the option to select a currency and the payment amount.
### Step 4: Comparing the FX rates
We can then compare the FX rates by calculating the implied FX rate and then marking the baked-in spread.
