The following guide will demonstrate how to scrape FX rates from online payment providers, such as Convera, illustrating the magnitude of the FX margins baked into the rates.
## Obtaining FX Rates From Convera
### Step 1: Opening students.convera.com
The first step to obtaining an FX rate from Convera is to type in the country of the school. Once the country field is completed, Convera will populate the drop-down list of institutions with all the schools from that institution.
### Step 2: Selecting an institution
Once the list of available institutions is created, the school can be selected. This step takes us to the next page of the process.
### Step 3: Select a country and payment amount
Convera then provides the option to select a currency and the payment amount.
### Step 4: Comparing the FX rates
We can then compare the FX rates by calculating the implied FX rate and then marking the baked-in spread.
## Framework

## Managing Cookies
To navigate between the pages, Convera uses request and response cookies. These cookies effectively serve as keys to access the next webpage, creating a chain of pages.
Take the following process as an example of how keys can form a chain of pages:
- Site A: Visiting this site gives CookieA.
- Site B: CookieA is required to access this site. Once this site is accessed, CookieB is given to the user.
- Site C: CookieB is required to access this site. Once this site is accessed, CookieC is given to the user.
- Site D: CookieC is required to access this site. This site then contains the information that we are aiming to scrape.

Therefore, to access Site D and its information, we need to start at Site A and go through the chain of sites to finally access Site D. It is impossible to access Site D directly, as it requires a cookie from the previous site, which requires a cookie from the previous site, and so on.
